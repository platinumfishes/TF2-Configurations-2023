Besides all custom files as seen in the repo, to finish the Tf2 experience we still need:

1- Hitsound/Killsound (B4nny hitsound, meme killsound)
2- Customized crosshair (prob on rayshud)
3- Hud, rayshud was too large to import into github (Go download urself)
4- Perhaps more customized binds for gameplays sake
